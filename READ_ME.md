# 🚇 Smart Metro Station Simulator

A C-based console application that simulates the functioning of a metro station
using fundamental data structures such as Queue, Stack, and Priority Queue.
The project models real-life metro operations including passenger management,
ticket booking, train arrival timings, and boarding simulation.

## ✨ Features

- Passenger entry with automatic token generation
- Priority-based passenger handling (VIP / Normal)
- Ticket booking system
- Ticket cancellation with undo functionality
- Train arrival time simulation with AM/PM format
- Displays multiple upcoming trains
- Supports Purple, Green, and Yellow metro lines
- Boarding simulation using queue logic

---

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

- Queue (Priority Queue) – for passenger management
- Stack – for undoing ticket cancellations
- Arrays – for storing metro stations
- Structures – for passenger details

---

## 🚉 Metro Lines Covered

- Purple Line
- Green Line
- Yellow Line

Each metro line consists of predefined stations.  
Train arrival time is calculated based on the current time and station distance.
